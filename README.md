# strumbra

strumbra is an implementation of the string data structure described in [Umbra: A Disk-Based System with In-Memory Performance](https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2020/papers/p29-neumann-cidr20.pdf).

This project is a Go port inspired by Le Tung Vo's article ["An Optimization Thatâ€™s Impossible in Rust!"](https://tunglevo.com/note/an-optimization-thats-impossible-in-rust) and their Rust implementation, [strumba](https://gitlab.com/ltungv/strumbra).

## Contributing

Please feel free to open an issue or a pull request. I'm happy to receive feedback and contributions. I'm not extremely experienced with advanced Go optimizations so I'm sure there are many improvements that can be made.
